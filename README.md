# JARVIS AI Chatbot
Welcome to JARVIS AI Chatbot, a project that integrates OpenAI's powerful language models with API interactions to create an intelligent virtual assistant.

# Overview
JARVIS AI Chatbot leverages OpenAI's language generation capabilities to provide natural and contextually relevant responses. It is designed to interact with users conversationally and perform tasks through API integrations.

# Features
Natural Language Processing: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 model for generating human-like text responses based on user input.
API Integrations: Interfaces with external APIs to fetch data, perform actions (such as retrieving weather information or fetching news headlines), and interact with services.
Customizable Responses: Configurable to handle various prompts and queries, with responses tailored to different scenarios.
Interactive Interface: Provides a user-friendly chat interface for seamless interaction.

# How It Works
OpenAI Integration: JARVIS utilizes the OpenAI API to generate responses dynamically based on conversational context.

API Integrations: Configured to interact with specific APIs (e.g., weather, news) to fetch real-time data and provide relevant information to users.

User Interaction: Users can engage with JARVIS through a chat interface, prompting responses and receiving information or performing actions.
